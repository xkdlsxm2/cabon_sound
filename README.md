# carbon_sound
This project is designed to make a sound when a spam email is removed.
Each alphabet makes a different sound. 
The main purpose of this project is to auralize garbage information in our mailboxes. 
By getting rid of those garbage information, we can reduce carbon consumption. 
Ultimately, this program audioizes the process of reducing carbon consumption in our digital life.
